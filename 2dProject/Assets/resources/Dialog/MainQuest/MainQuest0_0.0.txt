Unngh I feel terrible
Go easy there. You were in an accident. You were badly hurt.
I don’t remember that. I… I don’t…
What can you remember?
Nothing, but I feel fine. Where are all my injuries I don't see any?
Oh wow you must be having some bad memory problems. I healed all your wounds with temporal magic. Do you remeber what that is?
I don't thinks so.
It's a branch of magic used to turn back time. I used in the parts of your body that were injured to restore them to a point in your life when they were healed. Is this familiar to you?
I don’t know. It’s all fuzzy.
Lets start with your name. Can you tell me your name?
