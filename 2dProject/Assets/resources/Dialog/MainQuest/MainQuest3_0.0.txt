What was that? I still don't have any of my memories.
That was a magical barrier that was put around your mind and it back fired when I tried to look inside.
What do you mean magical barrier, what does that mean?
I'll chalk it up to your memory loss, but you probably forgot that you had a barrier around your mind or you'd have told me about it. It most likely means that you are a magician. Do you recall?
I can't say that I remember, but are you sure I'm a magician?
I'm pretty sure, a barrier like that would take time to put up and I’d doubt that you'd let someone do that to you even if you weren't a magician nor do I see a reason for anyone to put up a barrier to keep people out of your mind unless you paid them, a lot.
Ok What do we do now?
We don’t do anything. I can’t help you unless I know what type of magic was used to create that barrier. To know that we probably need to know what type of magician you are.
What can I do then? I want to get my memory back.
You can go to the industrial area and put in an order for a testing device. I can use it to determine what Type of magic you use and then we can remove that barrier and I can get your memories back.
