OK that's enough you're finsihed.
Shut up, it's not enough ---- that you killed me, you got to rub it in. Just let me ---- die in peace already.
I didn't want to fight you in the first place. Everything that happened here was your doing.
My doing? Yeah I suppose ------ that's true. I chose to take the job. I just didn't know ------ what I was getting involved in.
And what was that exactly?  I don't understand what's going on.
So you really did lose your memory. You forgot -------- everything?
Yes I've forgotten and I'm trying to get it back. Will you tell me how I know you?
You don't -------- know me. I was just an engineer, but I remeber -------- you. It was as if you were the royalty there. Everyone walked on egg shells around you. Like they were afraid-------------.
