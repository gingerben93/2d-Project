I think that’s it.
Think? Did you just make that up?
I don’t know it felt right. Can you help me with my memory? Why didn't you use temporal magic on my head?
It's to advanced for me. Working with the mind is more complicated. I did everything I could in my power to heal your body and you’ve been fully restored. I don’t have to capability to do what you’re asking and honestly I don’t have the time. There’s someone another doctor next door He might be able to help.
What's their name? Are they likely to help me?
I can’t say for sure. There name is CH1 You’ll just have to go find out for yourself. And look I’m sorry I can’t help more, but I run this place alone and I got stuff to take care of.
